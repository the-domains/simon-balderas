Sister is a coming-of-age short film that parallels the lives and perspectives of an older and much younger sister. 

Constance is at the end of her childhood and has already faced some of the harsher realities of life. 

Junie still sees the world through the eyes of an innocent, carefree and trusting six-year-old. When their mother goes away on yet another business trip, things begin to crumble just a little bit more. 

Constance leaves Junie alone for the day as she heads off to work and Junie is left to fend for herself. Junie's day is filled with boredom, whimsy, adventure, and the inevitable exposure to what exists on the not too distant horizon. 

Director Simon Balderas says he chose to tell this story of a broken family through the eyes of its youngest member. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/810280d2-47b5-4bde-b1aa-3d55a96174ec.jpg)

"The most beautiful and vulnerable thing about children is their trust in the world,  and seeing that on screen is endearing. But that innocence is fleeting and watching that specific moment when it is lost forever is as bittersweet as it is inevitable."
