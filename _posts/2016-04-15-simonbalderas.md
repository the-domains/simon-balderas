Simon Balderas graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Film Studies.  At an unusually young age, he became an accomplished photographer, spending  hours in the darkroom and photographing in a journalistic style.   While still in grammar school, his interest in photography  evolved into filmmaking.  He first experimented with 8mm stop-motion and then moved into narrative projects. While in college, Simon wrote and directed two award-winning shorts. At 21, he began editing television documentaries for the next several years. At 24, he made his first feature film, inspired by his Mexican heritage.  Since that time Simon has become an accomplished documentary director, a talented cinematographer, and a highly skilled editor whose work has garnered numerous awards.

Throughout his career, he has always been driven by stories of the human condition, and his character-driven scripts always make the audience think. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92913718-32a3-463f-b6c3-a1aa5b338547.jpg)

A skilled cinematographer, he is able to see the world from the perspective of whatever character is being portrayed.  The camera becomes that character's eyes,  and he subtly, yet visually points out things that others may not see. His stlye is distinguished by lyrical storytelling and rich visuals.
