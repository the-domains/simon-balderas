            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bio</h1><p>Simon Balderas graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Film Studies.  At an unusually young age, he became an accomplished photographer, spending  hours in the darkroom and photographing in a journalistic style.   While still in grammar school, his interest in photography  evolved into filmmaking.  He first experimented with 8mm stop-motion and then moved into narrative projects. While in college, Simon wrote and directed two award-winning shorts. At 21, he began editing television documentaries for the next several years. At 24, he made his first feature film, inspired by his Mexican heritage.  Since that time Simon has become an accomplished documentary director, a talented cinematographer, and a highly skilled editor whose work has garnered numerous awards.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c396d7cb75fcba46421cdc062f29d313a492b1ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Spending time with my kids</h1><p>The more time you spend with your children, the more attuned you will be to their emerging abilities. Those fathers who spend little time with their children frequently either underestimate or overestimate the developmental progress of their sons and daughters. If you underestimate your child's competence, you won't provide adequate challenge or stimulation. Your child will be bored. If you overestimate your child's skills, your unrealistic expectations will prove to be a frustrating and unpleasant experience for him and you. In either case, your child will be less motivated to interact with you in the future.</p></article>]]></description>
